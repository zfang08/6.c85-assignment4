		<h2>Dataset and Topic: Civilian Complaints Against New York City Police Officers.</h2>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>This is a dataset compiled by ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit investigative journalism newsroom. It contains more than 12,000 civilian complaints filed against the NYPD, with demographic information about the complainant and officer, the category of the alleged misconduct, and the result of the complaint.</li>
				<li> The dataset consists of 33,358 records and 27 variables detailing civilian complaints against NYPD officers.</li>
			</ul>


        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>Temporal Trends</li>
				<li>Officer and Complainant related Patterns</li>
				<li>Allegation and Complaint Type Patterns</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Temporal Trends</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>How has the number of complaints changed over time?(is there an increase or decrease overtime?)
			</li>
			<li>Are there seasonal patterns in complaints?</li>
		</ul>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/over years number.png" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				From the hitogram, we can see that the number of complaints against NYPD has increased drastically over the years. From the beginnning where the number fell below 100 from 1985 to 1900, this number has increased to above 1500 in years after 2005. This is perhaps due to the proliferation of the internet, and ease of use of telecommunication devices, which enabled faster report of complaints.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/across months.png" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				As for the number of complaints by month. We can see that the data follows a discrete bimodal distribution, with the number of complaints spiking around March and April as well as July and August. This suggest that these are the time where there is increased outdoor activities in New York City.

		<h3>Officer and Complainant related Patterns</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Which Precincts have the most complaints?
			</li>
			<li>Are certain officer ranks more frequently complained about?</li>
			<li>Are certain age groups of complainants more likely to file complaints?</li>
			<li>Is there a pattern between complainant demographics and the officer demographics?</li>
			<li>Is there a pattern between complainant demographics and the type of complaints filed?</li>

		</ul>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Top 10 precincts with most complaint.png" alt="" width="1000" />
			<figcaption>
				According to the histogram, the number of complaints is relatively stable and evenly distributed across the precinct. However, for precinct 75, there is a disproportionate number of complaints, almost double that of the rest of any other single precinct. Precinct 75 is the easternmost part of Brooklyn, and has been considered as one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the NYC, having one of the highest murder rates in the country during the late 1980s. This suggest that The high number of complaints could be highly correlated with high number of crimes.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Allegations by rank.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				Looking at the complaints by officer rank, we can see that police officer, detective, and sergeant are three of the most complained ranks among all complaints. This suggest that frontlin officers interact with the public most frequently. As they are typically engaged in direct law enforcement activities, they consequently receive more complaints.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Complainant age.png" alt=""width="1000" />
			<figcaption>
			  According to the Complainant Age distribution, we can see that the mode bin for complainant's age is 30, and second and third most common ages are between 20-30. This suggests that the complainants are mostly yound individuals.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/Race Matrix.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				In terms of demographics, we observe a clear pattern in the race matrix. Certain racial groups appear more frequently as complainants against specific officer demographics, highlighting potential disparities in police interactions. This distribution may suggest underlying social dynamics, differences in policing strategies across communities, or varying levels of trust in the complaint process. Further analysis could help uncover whether these patterns reflect broader systemic issues or are influenced by external factors such as neighborhood demographics and reporting tendencies.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/Complaint type and race.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				Notably, Abuse of Authority emerges as the most common complaint type, followed by Force. This suggests that many allegations stem from perceived misuse of power—such as unlawful stops, searches, or intimidation—rather than physical confrontations alone. However, the significant presence of force-related complaints indicates that concerns over excessive physical actions by officers remain a key issue.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h3>Allegation and Complaint Type Patterns</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>What are the most common types of allegations?</li>
			<li>Are some misconduct types more likely to be substantiated than others?</li>

		</ul>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Most common type of allegations.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				The histogram reveals that Physical Force and Offensive Language are among the most common allegations filed against officers. The high frequency of Physical Force complaints suggests that concerns about excessive or unnecessary force remain a significant issue in police interactions. This could include allegations related to aggressive restraint, unjustified use of weapons, or forceful physical handling of civilians. Meanwhile, the prevalence of Offensive Language complaints indicates ongoing concerns about verbal misconduct, such as the use of slurs, derogatory remarks, or inappropriate language by officers. These findings highlight two distinct but critical areas of concern—one focusing on physical confrontations and the other on verbal interactions—which together shape public perceptions of police conduct and accountability.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Type of allegation and Exonerated.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				This visualization examined the relationship between allegation types and exoneration rates. Notability, Offensive Language and Discoutesy complaints are the most likely to be unsubstantiated, suggesting that allegations related to verbal misconduct often lack sufficient evidence and are difficult to verify. Howerver, Force and Abuse of Authority complaints have higher likelihood of being exhonerated, meaning that while the incidents are confirmed, they were considered to be within polict. This suggest that the standards of justifying force provide officers with broader freedom and discrestion.

    <h2>Proposition: "Complaints against NYPD officers are rarely substantiated, making police accountability ineffective."</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/newplot2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The Sankey diagram illustrates how complaints flow from officer rank to allegation type and ultimately to board disposition. A clear pattern emerges: a substantial number of allegations, particularly those related to Abuse of Authority and Use of Force, result in either Unsubstantiated or Exonerated findings. This suggests that despite civilians filing a high volume of complaints, the majority fail to lead to accountability or disciplinary action. Lower-ranking officers, such as police officers and sergeants, account for the highest share of complaints, reinforcing the idea that those with the most public-facing interactions are also the most frequently accused of misconduct. The visualization supports the argument that police accountability is ineffective, as the system tends to dismiss or justify a large proportion of complaints.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose sankey diagram to show proportion. Particularly, we see that the majority of complaints are by police officers and detective, and they fall under abuse of authority , and force.   </li>
				<li>I chose to represent the portion which is substantiated in green, and the unsubstantiated and exonerated both in red. This call attention to the fact that large proporition of allegations remain unsubstantiated. This grouping of unsubstantiated and exonerated tries to deceive the user into comparing substantiated vs. unsubstantiated. </li>
				<li>I chose the colors deliberately to create a contrast between accountability and dismissal. Green is commonly associated with success, validation, or progress, making substantiated complaints appear small but important. In contrast, red is often linked to warnings, failures, or injustice, emphasizing the overwhelming share of complaints that do not lead to discipline. This color selection subtly reinforces the argument that the system overwhelmingly dismisses complaints rather than holding officers accountable。</li>
			</ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/Screenshot 2025-03-08 155600.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				The line chart tracks the percentage of substantiated complaints over time, showing a slow but upward trend. While substantiation rates remain relatively low, the data shows that accountability mechanisms have been improving over the years, with more complaints being formally recognized and acted upon. The inclusion of a regression trend line further emphasizes this gradual increase, countering the notion that police misconduct consistently goes unchecked. This challenges the argument that accountability is entirely ineffective, instead suggesting that reforms or oversight measures may be leading to incremental but measurable progress in how complaints are handled.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose a line chart to emphasize the trend over time. Unlike the Sankey diagram, which focuses on proportions, the line chart highlights how substantiation rates have changed over the years, providing a temporal perspective on police accountability. This format allows the viewer to see whether the system has improved or remained stagnant over time.</li>
				<li>I included a regression trend line to make the increasing trend more visible. While the year-over-year fluctuations might make it harder to see a clear pattern, the trend line reinforces the idea that substantiation rates are gradually rising. This helps counter the argument that police accountability has remained ineffective. Instead we see that accountability has improved over the years. </li>
				<li>I used green to represent substantiated complaints, reinforcing a positive narrative. Since green is commonly associated with success.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Going through this process, I realized how much power visualization has in shaping a narrative. The Sankey diagram made it easy to highlight the sheer number of complaints that remain unsubstantiated or exonerated, pushing the idea that police accountability is weak. On the other hand, the line chart told a very different story—by showing a slow but steady increase in substantiation rates, it suggested that accountability is improving over time. Some parts of this were pretty straightforward, like picking colors and choosing chart types that best fit the argument. But what was tricky was figuring out where to draw the line between persuasion and manipulation. Small choices, like grouping unsubstantiated and exonerated cases together in red or using a trend line to smooth out fluctuations, made a big difference in how the data was interpreted.

		What surprised me the most was how easy it is to nudge people toward a certain conclusion without technically lying. I wouldn’t have thought that just changing the way categories are grouped or adjusting color choices could make the same dataset feel completely different. This made me rethink what ethical visualization really means. It’s not just about presenting accurate numbers—it’s also about being honest with how those numbers are framed. Some persuasive choices, like emphasizing important trends, feel fair, but others, like hiding key context or exaggerating differences, start to cross the line into misleading territory. At the end of the day, intent matters. If a visualization is designed to help people understand data, that’s fine. But if it’s designed to push a specific agenda while hiding nuance, that’s where it starts to feel dishonest.</p>
