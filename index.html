		<h2>Dataset and Topic: Civilian Complaints Against New York City Police Officers.</h2>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>This is a dataset compiled by ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit investigative journalism newsroom. It contains more than 12,000 civilian complaints filed against the NYPD, with demographic information about the complainant and officer, the category of the alleged misconduct, and the result of the complaint.</li>
				<li> The dataset consists of 33,358 records and 27 variables detailing civilian complaints against NYPD officers.</li>
			</ul>


        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>Temporal Trends</li>
				<li>Officer and Complainant related Patterns</li>
				<li>Allegation and Complaint Type Patterns</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Temporal Trends</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>How has the number of complaints changed over time?(is there an increase or decrease overtime?)
			</li>
			<li>Are there seasonal patterns in complaints?</li>
		</ul>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/over years number.png" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				From the hitogram, we can see that the number of complaints against NYPD has increased drastically over the years. From the beginnning where the number fell below 100 from 1985 to 1900, this number has increased to above 1500 in years after 2005. This is perhaps due to the proliferation of the internet, and ease of use of telecommunication devices, which enabled faster report of complaints.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/across months.png" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				As for the number of complaints by month. We can see that the data follows a discrete bimodal distribution, with the number of complaints spiking around March and April as well as July and August. This suggest that these are the time where there is increased outdoor activities in New York City.

		<h3>Officer and Complainant related Patterns</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Which Precincts have the most complaints?
			</li>
			<li>Are certain officer ranks more frequently complained about?</li>
			<li>Are certain age groups of complainants more likely to file complaints?</li>
			<li>Is there a pattern between complainant demographics and the officer demographics?</li>
			<li>Is there a pattern between complainant demographics and the type of complaints filed?</li>

		</ul>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Top 10 precincts with most complaint.png" alt="" width="1000" />
			<figcaption>
				According to the histogram, the number of complaints is relatively stable and evenly distributed across the precinct. However, for precinct 75, there is a disproportionate number of complaints, almost double that of the rest of any other single precinct. Precinct 75 is the easternmost part of Brooklyn, and has been considered as one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the NYC, having one of the highest murder rates in the country during the late 1980s. This suggest that The high number of complaints could be highly correlated with high number of crimes.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Allegations by rank.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				Looking at the complaints by officer rank, we can see that police officer, detective, and sergeant are three of the most complained ranks among all complaints. This suggest that frontlin officers interact with the public most frequently. As they are typically engaged in direct law enforcement activities, they consequently receive more complaints.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Complainant age.png" alt=""width="1000" />
			<figcaption>
			  According to the Complainant Age distribution, we can see that the mode bin for complainant's age is 30, and second and third most common ages are between 20-30. This suggests that the complainants are mostly yound individuals.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>


		<figure>
			<img src="images/Race Matrix.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				In terms of demographics, we observe a clear pattern in the race matrix. Certain racial groups appear more frequently as complainants against specific officer demographics, highlighting potential disparities in police interactions. This distribution may suggest underlying social dynamics, differences in policing strategies across communities, or varying levels of trust in the complaint process. Further analysis could help uncover whether these patterns reflect broader systemic issues or are influenced by external factors such as neighborhood demographics and reporting tendencies.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Complaint type and race.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				Notably, Abuse of Authority emerges as the most common complaint type, followed by Force. This suggests that many allegations stem from perceived misuse of power—such as unlawful stops, searches, or intimidation—rather than physical confrontations alone. However, the significant presence of force-related complaints indicates that concerns over excessive physical actions by officers remain a key issue.

		<h3>Allegation and Complaint Type Patterns</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>What are the most common types of allegations?</li>
			<li>Are some misconduct types more likely to be substantiated than others?</li>

		</ul>

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Most common type of allegations.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				The histogram reveals that Physical Force and Offensive Language are among the most common allegations filed against officers. The high frequency of Physical Force complaints suggests that concerns about excessive or unnecessary force remain a significant issue in police interactions. This could include allegations related to aggressive restraint, unjustified use of weapons, or forceful physical handling of civilians. Meanwhile, the prevalence of Offensive Language complaints indicates ongoing concerns about verbal misconduct, such as the use of slurs, derogatory remarks, or inappropriate language by officers. These findings highlight two distinct but critical areas of concern—one focusing on physical confrontations and the other on verbal interactions—which together shape public perceptions of police conduct and accountability.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/Type of allegation and Exonerated.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
			<figcaption>
				This visualization examined the relationship between allegation types and exoneration rates. Notability, Offensive Language and Discoutesy complaints are the most likely to be unsubstantiated, suggesting that allegations related to verbal misconduct often lack sufficient evidence and are difficult to verify. Howerver, Force and Abuse of Authority complaints have higher likelihood of being exhonerated, meaning that while the incidents are confirmed, they were considered to be within polict. This suggest that the standards of justifying force provide officers with broader freedom and discrestion.
